After attending MaSSP 2023, I really do feel the need to learn how to... learn. I just realized that since August 2023, I have been dealing with so many hard stuffs from: abstract maths concepts in RL; some un-codable or un-calculatable processes like GSEA, projected risks of breast cancer; complicated logic in computer architects. It is the type of "hard" when I studied Olympics Maths in high school when it was always guruanteed that there would be a solution awaiting for me at the end of the road (if not, there is no need to do that problem) despite the problem's difficulty. The type of "hard" I faced, am facing and will definitely face more in the future is that:

- When I encounter a new problem or new concept, it maybe will take a very long time to read, to search for the damn documents and t(c)ry a lot to understand them.

- Be sure about whether I really understand them or not?

- Sometimes, ofc I will read and try to understand something that is totally unecessary and not useful for my project

Some rules I have concluded:

**1; Rule number one**: if you can't explain one concept in your own language so others can understand, you haven't understood it. This is one lesson from one of my mentor in MaSSP 2023 that I carved to my heart. I believe that everyone will experience this when you read something and feel like "gotcha!" :); but when others ask you to explain that terminology again you will be confused and realize you haven't understood it thoroughly :)

How to solve that problem: I don't know bro :); still try to figure out

**2; Rule number two**: the learning process of something new is usually like
- The definition
- Explain of that definition
- Example
- Pros and cons of that 
- When to use or why use that thing
- The upgraded version of that (maybe also the reasons why the old version still exists)
