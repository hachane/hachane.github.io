This is stupid af :)) but lol, for some reasons, I often trap myself in some lol bugs that normal people will never encounter :)) so just a post to keep my stupid mistakes so I (hopefully somebody) can look up for it in the future if ... that bug appears again:

- Jekyll bug: 
    - Don't name your posts with the date exceeds your current date or it won't be rendered :). Today is 7/2/2024 and yesterday was 6/2/2024. I spent a whole day just to look at and check whether the for loop in index.html had any faults and it turned out that my posts were not rendered because I name the posts as 8/2/2024 and 19/2/2024.
