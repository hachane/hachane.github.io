This is stupid af :)) but lol, for some reasons, I often trap myself in some lol bugs that normal people will never encounter :)) so just a post to keep my stupid mistakes so I (hopefully somebody) can look up for it in the future if ... that bug appears again:

- Jekyll bug: 
    - Don't name your posts with the date exceeds your current date or it won't be rendered :). Today is 7/2/2024 and yesterday was 6/2/2024. I spent a whole day just to look at and check whether the for loop in index.html had any faults and it turned out that my posts were not rendered because I name the posts as 8/2/2024 and 19/2/2024.
    - My Jekyll blog took too much time to compile and update, push into the github

- Install stuffs bug:
    - what is PATH in your computer: (for cmd stuffs)
    - what is anaconda and where your python libs run everytime you "import"
    - what is python env
    - how is the data in your computer arranged (local data / roaming / ....)

- Some Kaggle notebooks:
    - Please save your contents (a runtime version). A version won't be save when your notebook still has bugs somewhere so it can't run the whole notebook.
    - Sometimes!! please do notice the environment which you are in. The environment is something like the env on your desktop (including which version of the library blah blah) so sometimes with the same code, you may be able to run at this notebook but not in other notebook.
    - Cannot commit to Github
    - You know you can actually turn off your computers and your notebooks still run?

- Python bugs:
    - Sometimes; in python file (or ipynb file as well) you need to change the directory by adding something like "os.chdir(r"D:\Download\Năm 2 kì 2\Xử lý ảnh\BT\HW2")" into the beginning so your file can read the image or something.
    - Setting up virtual environments, anaconda stuffs

- Github bugs stuff:
    - Please always remember to write your commit message when pushing code in VSCode, if not it will never be able to push it onto Github (i mean it will take ages with endless 3 dots):)) and VSCode doesn't warn you either.
