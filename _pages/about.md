This is the first version of my website :). In this year, I will try my best to upgrade it from the front-end to the quality of my posts, my English as well... Also trying to become rich so I can pay to make this website appears on SEO in order to serve its right purposes. üòÇ

**For non-tech readers** üé§üò∏üå∏

After 3 (or 4) years of procrastination, this lazy gal has finally penned her first complete blog post :). It is not on Facebook nor Spiderum, it is on her own website! (hosted by github). This will be more like a tech blog but its owner sometimes also wants to share about her life too. Therefore, there will be some personal posts maybe on some occasions like: in the holiday when she is taking a breath from the deadlines, in the middle or at the end of the semester when she is usually too depressed with the tests :) or when she achieves something and she wants to share her experience. As everyone says, one may have multiple personalities when thinking in different languages so her posts will switch between English and Vietnamese depending on her moods, her understanding levels or her vocabulary... (just because she feels more comfortable to express herself in English despite her lack of vocabulary). In the future; I will add an own section named "daily" for this. Thanks a lot for reading!

**For tech readers** üíª

Welcome to ha's cooking pot website, a quirky blog by a computer science student who realized she spent way too much time on random things - from drowning in papers to coding stuff that didn't quite match her future path. Think of this as her personal collection, gathering what she's read and done, hoping it saves someone else's time (so they won‚Äôt have to spend tons of time reading and searching like her)

This space won't bore you with common Google-able knowledge (okay, maybe a bit, when she feels lazy but needs a push to study). This website's owner also loves to share and discuss about knowlege so sometimes when she finds a topic too abstract or unintelligible; she will write a post to express her own understanding, her own language (If you find any mistakes of this dumbass, please send an email to tangha2005@gmail.com correct her!). Expect a bunch of topics like:

- **B**: Bioinformatics takes the spotlight, given her lab life

(Just a pic to make your reading less boring (‚Å†~‚Å†‚Äæ‚Å†‚ñø‚Å†‚Äæ‚Å†)‚Å†~)

- **ML**: Can't ignore the AI hype, but she won't focus too much and ML posts will be more like her self-study journey, summarizing books. Please forgive her mistakes or being dumb in Maths.
AI: Quick notes from her AI subjects at UET, just in case someone needs them down the line. Future usefulness, you never know.

- **SW**: Software subjects at her school is just way damn heavy, or at least she thinks so. Everything here serves the same purpose as the AI part - a digital time capsule, just in case.

- **CS**: Yep, because it tortured her so much. With that CS student title, she's determined to at least flex a bit and put her knowledge to use.

- **Stat**: Just because she had to deal with it way too much.

In the future; I will add one (or many) own section (named "tech",...) for these stuffs above.They say in research, only 20% is gold, and the rest is just searching for that gold. For her, it feels like 99.99% useless and 0.01% gold. So here's her attempt to squeeze that 0.01% and save others from wandering in the 99.99% wasteland. Cheers to hoping no one wastes as much time as she did!

Wishing for a year filled with plenty of coding and few bugs!
