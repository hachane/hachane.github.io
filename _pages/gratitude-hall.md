Just want to express my sincere gratitude for people who have guided/helped me a lot through difficult times of my life. Come to think about that :) I don't know even how I would have got through these times if I hadn't met them/ had them by my side. I am so sorry for this simple front-end and promise to upgrade it in this year. (sorry again for my bad English):

My mentors at MaSSP 2023, sister Linh and brother Thanh whom I really  respect, admire and grateful. It was just a great fortune of me to be able to meet them when they taught me a lot of things, supported me both in the summer camp and afterwards in other stuffs. I just want to thank them a lot for helping and supporting me unconditionally.

My old high school classmate - roomate Nhi, who inspired me a lot to change and had a huge effect on my perspective of life.

My old teacher Hieu - who taught me Chemisty at class 11. Despite our short meet, the impression left in me was significant.

Doctor Diep - who have guided me in science research during my college time (now and also in the future).

My buddies; from my highschool friends, my old roomates to my current college friends; for supporting me not only in studying but also in many other aspects, getting through the hard time together and putting up with my dumbness and annoyingness :). I just want to say I was so damn lucky to meet everyone and thank you so much :)

And of course, my family for always loving, supporting me unconditionally.

***Thank you so much for being parts of my life!***
